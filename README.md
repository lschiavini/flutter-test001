Flutter Implementation with Clean Architecture and Modular Design
This repository contains a simple Flutter implementation that follows Clean Architecture and Modular Design principles. The purpose of this project is to provide an example of how to structure a Flutter app using these principles to make it more organized, maintainable, and testable.

Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that aims to create software that is independent of frameworks, platforms, and databases. It does this by separating the software into layers that depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. The layers in Clean Architecture are:

Presentation Layer: This layer contains the UI of the app and is responsible for displaying data to the user and receiving input from the user.
Domain Layer: This layer contains the business logic of the app and is responsible for performing the use cases of the app.
Data Layer: This layer contains the implementation details of how to get and save data from external sources.

Modular Design
Modular Design is a design pattern that aims to create software that is composed of independent, reusable modules. Each module should have a single responsibility and be easy to maintain and test.

The implementation of this project uses the following technologies:
Flutter: A framework for building native apps for iOS, Android, and the web.

The code is organized according to the Clean Architecture and Modular Design principles, making it easy to understand and maintain. The app is also testable, with unit tests for the business logic and integration tests for the UI.

Conclusion
This project provides a simple example of how to structure a Flutter app using Clean Architecture and Modular Design principles. By following these principles, you can create apps that are more organized, maintainable, and testable.

Note: This is simply a example of how to structure a Flutter app using Clean Architecture and Modular Design principles created for a demonstration. It is not a production-ready app.
